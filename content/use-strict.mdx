1. Preventing global variables: Strict mode prevents the accidental creation of global variables by throwing an error when you try to assign a value to an undeclared variable.
2. Improving code safety: Strict mode disables certain features of JavaScript that are considered unsafe, such as modifying the behavior of **`this`** in certain situations.
3. Enhancing code quality: Strict mode makes it easier to write secure and more reliable code by catching typos and other mistakes early in the development process.
4. Better error handling: Strict mode makes it easier to catch and handle errors by making it mandatory to include a catch block when using a **`try-catch`** statement.
5. Better compatibility: Strict mode ensures that your code is compatible with future versions of JavaScript, as new features and changes to the language will not break your code if it is written in strict mode.
6. Simplifying code maintenance: Strict mode helps maintain the code quality by making it easier to find and fix bugs in the code.

It is important to note that strict mode only affects the code contained within the same script or function where it is declared, so you can use strict mode in specific parts of your code while keeping other parts relaxed.
