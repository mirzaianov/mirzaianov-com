If you’re like me you always need to look up the difference between local storage, session storage and cookies.

This post is for those’s that are always reaching for that comparison.

## Local Storage

- Stores data with no expiry date
- Cleared only via JavaScript or clearing browser cache
- The storage limit is the largest of the 3 as big as 5MB
- Not supported by older browsers IE7 or lower
- Works on the same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.

## Session Storage

- Stores data only for the duration of the session, when the user closes their browser the data is lost
- Top-level browsing context, therefore it’s unique to each browser tab
- The storage limit is larger than cookies at 5MB
- Not supported by older browsers IE7 or lower

## Cookies

- Stores data that can be transferred to the server via headers
- LocalStorage and SessionStorage can only be accessed on client-side
- Expiry is set on the creation of the cookie
- The storage limit is smallest at 4kb
- Cookies can be made secure making client side unable to read the contents. This is important for authentication to store user tokens.
