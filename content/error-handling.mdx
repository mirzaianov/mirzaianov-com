## Introduction

Expert developers expect the unexpected. If something can go wrong, it will go wrong — _typically, the moment the first user accesses your new web system_.

We can avoid some web application errors like so:

- A good editor or linter can catch syntax errors.
- Good validation can catch user input errors.
- Robust test processes can spot logic errors.

Yet errors remain. Browsers may fail or not support an API we’re using. Servers can fail or take too long to respond. Network connectivity can fail or become unreliable. Issues may be temporary, but we can’t code our way around such problems. However, we can anticipate problems, take remedial actions, and make our application more resilient.
