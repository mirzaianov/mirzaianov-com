## [](https://joyofcode.xyz/test-your-site-in-every-browser#what-are-the-major-browsers)What Are The Major Browsers?

In this post you‚Äôre going to learn how to check your site look great in every major browser including Chrome, Firefox and Safari regardless if you‚Äôre using Linux, macOS or Windows.

If you look at the [browser market share worldwide](https://gs.statcounter.com/) Chrome is leading at **64%** while Safari has close to **20%** and Firefox **4%** of the market share (rest in peace Internet Explorer üíê).

Why are these the major browsers demanding our attention?

The reason is because these browsers have the highest market share but each has their own [browser engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine) (the browser engine is responsible for rendering the page on your screen) that makes it different enough resulting in having to test for it.

Most browsers such as [Brave](https://brave.com/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) among other browsers are [Chromium](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)>)\-based ‚Äî the same browser that [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) uses meaning they are the same in that regard:

- Chrome uses [Blink](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)>) developed as part of the Chromium project as a fork of WebKit
- Firefox uses [Gecko](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)>) developed by [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)
- Safari uses [WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit) developed by [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.)

This explains why we test for these browsers but the problem is that only Chrome and Firefox are available on all platforms but Safari is [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) only, so you‚Äôre out of luck if you‚Äôre a Linux or Windows user ‚Äî so what can you do?

If you‚Äôre a Linux user you‚Äôre in luck because you can use a WebKit based browser such as [Epiphany](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web) and it works great without any setup ‚Äî it‚Äôs not going to match all the features of Safari but the browser engine they use is the same.

Windows on the other hand doesn‚Äôt have any WebKit based browser you can use as far as I‚Äôm aware of, so you would have to use a virtual machine or use the latest [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) that can use a graphical user interface and use Epiphany.

Instead of doing that you can use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) which is used for automated testing and has the ability to test every browser ‚Äî this works because Playwright ships a binary for every browser including Chromium, Firefox and WebKit using their open source builds.

This is also useful to have a clean browser testing environment without extensions that can cause interference.

If you‚Äôre not familiar with the JavaScript ecosystem you‚Äôre going to need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For Linux use Epiphany to test for Safari because Playwright only supports Ubuntu 20.04 LTS at the time of writing this, so you would have to use [Boxes](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Boxes) on unsupported Linux distributions.

Here is how to set up Playwright.

1\. Initialize a new project inside an empty repository.

```
  npm init -y
```

2\. Install `@playwright/test` as a development dependency.

```
  npm i -D @playwright/test
```

3\. Install the default browsers.

```
  npx playwright install
```

4\. Update `package.json`

The [Playwright CLI](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli) has some interesting options we can use like `--headed` and `--browser=webkit` to specify the browser so we can add these as **scripts** to `package.json`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:chrome": "npx playwright test --headed --browser=chromium",
    "test:firefox": "npx playwright test --headed --browser=firefox",
    "test:safari": "npx playwright test --headed --browser=webkit"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@playwright/test": "^1.22.1"
  }
}
```

> üêøÔ∏è The `npx` command avoids having to install a package globally by downloading and executing the binary.

5\. Add a test for Playwright

This is only so you can specify what page to visit and pause the browser so you can inspect the page ‚Äî if you comment out the `page.goto` line it‚Äôs going to open a blank tab.

```ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('test browser', async ({ page }) => {
  // point this to wherever you want
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/');

  // keep browser open
  await page.pause();
});
```

6\. Run the test using one of the scripts.

```
  npm run test:safari
```

That‚Äôs it! üéâ
