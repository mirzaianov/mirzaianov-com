| Area                                | Undefined                                                                            | Null                                                                                                    |

| Definition                          | Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. | Null means an empty value or a blank value.                                                             |
| The typeof operator                 | The typeof() operator returns **undefined** for an undefined variable.               | The typeof() operator returns the type as an **object** for a variable whose value is assigned as null. |
| On performing arithmetic operations | It returns **NaN** on performing arithmetic operations.                              | converts to 0 then perform the operation                                                                |
| Is it an assignment value?          | No, as there is no value assigned to the variable, it becomes undefined.             | Yes, as we assign null to a variable, it is an assignment value.                                        |
