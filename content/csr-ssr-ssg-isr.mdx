Hello there,

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a very popular React framework and one of the beautiful features is the ability to build your web application using different rendering techniques, such as

- **CSR** - Client Side Rendering
- **SSR** - Server Side Rendering
- **SSG** - Static Site Generation
- **ISR** - Incremental Static Regeneration

In this post, I will focus on explaining and comparing these techniques using visual diagrams with minimal texts, and my goal is to create a _short note_ that you can quickly refer when needed.

Having said that, this post does not cover advance technical details and code snippets, that you might want to learn as a web developer.

Let's get started..!
