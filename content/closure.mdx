As the title states, JavaScript closures have always been a bit of a mystery to me. I have [read](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lets-learn-javascript-closures-66feb44f6a44) [multiple](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/whats-a-javascript-closure-in-plain-english-please-6a1fc1d2ff1c) [articles](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)>), I have used closures in my work, sometimes I even used a closure without realizing I was using a closure.

Recently I went to a talk where someone really explained it in a way it finally clicked for me. I’ll try to take this approach to explain closures in this article. Let me give credit to the great folks at [CodeSmith](https://www.codesmith.io/) and their _JavaScript The Hard Parts_ series.

## Before we start

Some concepts are important to grok before you can grok closures. One of them is the _execution context_.

[This article](http://davidshariff.com/blog/what-is-the-execution-context-in-javascript/) has a very good primer on Execution Context. To quote the article:

> When code is run in JavaScript, the environment in which it is executed is very important, and is evaluated as 1 of the following:
>
> **Global code** — The default environment where your code is executed for the first time.
>
> **Function code** — Whenever the flow of execution enters a function body.
>
> (…)
>
> (…), let’s think of the term `execution context` as the environment / scope the current code is being evaluated in.

In other words, as we start the program, we start in the global execution context. Some variables are declared within the global execution context. We call these global variables. When the program calls a function, what happens? A few steps:

1.  JavaScript creates a new execution context, a local execution context
2.  That local execution context will have its own set of variables, these variables will be local to that execution context.
3.  The new execution context is thrown onto the _execution stack_. Think of the execution stack as a mechanism to keep track of where the program is in its execution

When does the function end? When it encounters a `return` statement or it encounters a closing bracket `}`. When a function ends, the following happens:

1.  The local execution contexts pops off the execution stack
2.  The functions sends the return value back to the calling context. The calling context is the execution context that called this function, it could be the global execution context or another local execution context. It is up to the calling execution context to deal with the return value at that point. The returned value could be an object, an array, a function, a boolean, anything really. If the function has no `return` statement, `undefined` is returned.
3.  The local execution context is destroyed. This is important. Destroyed. All the variables that were declared within the local execution context are erased. They are no longer available. That’s why they’re called local variables.
