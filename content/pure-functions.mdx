### The Checklist

A function must pass two tests to be considered “pure”:

1.  Same inputs _always_ return same outputs
2.  No side-effects

Let’s zoom in on each one.

### 1\. Same Input => Same Output

Compare this:

```
  const add = (x, y) => x + y;

  add(2, 4); // 6
```

To this:

```
  let x = 2;

  const add = (y) => {
    x += y;
  };

  add(4); // x === 6 (the first time)
```

#### Pure Functions = Consistent Results

The first example returns a value based on the given parameters, regardless of where/when you call it.

If you pass `2` and `4`, you’ll always get `6`.

Nothing else affects the output.

#### Impure Functions = Inconsistent Results

The second example returns nothing. It relies on **shared state** to do its job by incrementing a variable outside of its own scope.

This pattern is a developer’s nightmare fuel.

**Shared state** introduces a time dependency. You get different results depending on when you called the function. The first time results in `6`, next time is `10` and so on.

#### Which Version’s Easier to Reason About?

Which one’s less likely to breed bugs that happen only under certain conditions?

Which one’s more likely to succeed in a multi-threaded environment where time dependencies can break the system?

Definitely the first one.

### 2\. No Side-Effects
