Let's take a look at the following code:

```
  const name = "Lydia"
  const age = 21
  const city = "San Francisco"

  function getPersonInfo() {
    const name = "Sarah"
    const age = 22

    return `${name} is ${age} and lives in ${city}`
  }

  console.log(getPersonInfo())
```

We're invoking the `getPersonInfo` function, which returns a string containing the values of the `name`, `age` and `city` variables:
`Sarah is 22 and lives in San Francisco`. But, the `getPersonInfo` function doesn't contain a variable named `city` ðŸ¤¨? How did it know the value of `city`?

First, memory space is set up for the different contexts. We have the default **global context** (`window` in a browser, `global` in Node), and a **local context** for the `getPersonInfo` function which has been invoked. Each context also has a **scope chain**.

For the `getPersonInfo` function, the scope chain looks something like this (don't worry, it doesn't have to make sense just yet):

The scope chain is basically a "chain of references" to objects that contain references to values (and other scopes) that are referencable in that execution context. (â›“: "Hey, these are all the values you can reference from within this context".) The scope chain gets created when the execution context is created, meaning it's created at runtime!

However, I won't talk about the _activation object_ or the execution contexts in general in this post, let's just focus on scope! In the following examples, the key/value pairs in the execution contexts represent the references that the scope chain has to the variables.

The scope chain of the global execution context has a reference to 3 variables: `name` with the value `Lydia`, `age` with the value `21`, and `city` with the value `San Francisco`. In the local context, we have a reference to 2 variables: `name` with the value `Sarah`, and `age` with the value `22`.

When we try to access the variables in the `getPersonInfo` function, the engine first checks the local scope chain.

The local scope chain has a reference to `name` and `age`! `name` has the value of `Sarah` and `age` has the value of `22`. But now, what happens when it tries to access `city`?

In order to find the value for `city` the engine "goes down the scope chain". This basically just means that the engine doesn't give up that easily: it works hard for you to see if it can find a value for the variable `city` in the outer scope that the local scope has a reference to, the **global object** in this case.

In the global context, we declared the variable `city` with the value of `San Francisco`, thus has a reference to the variable `city`. Now that we have a value for the variable, the function `getPersonInfo` can return the string `Sarah is 22 and lives in San Francisco` ðŸŽ‰
