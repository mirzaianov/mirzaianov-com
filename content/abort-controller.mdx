Today, I'd like to talk about one of the standard JavaScript APIs you are likely sleeping on. It's called `AbortController`.

## What is `AbortController`?

[`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) is a global class in JavaScript that you can use to abort, well, anything!

Here's how you use it:

```bash
  const controller = new AbortController()

  controller.signal
  controller.abort()
```

Once you create a controller instance, you get two things:

- The `signal` property, which is an instance of [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal). This is a pluggable part you can provide to any API to react to an abort event, and implement it accordingly. For example, providing it to a `fetch()` request will abort the request;
- The `.abort()` method that, when called, triggers the abort event on the `signal`. It also updates the signal to be marked as aborted.
