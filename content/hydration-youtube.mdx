Hydration in web development is the process of making server-rendered HTML interactive on the client-side. After a server sends static HTML to the browser, client-side JavaScript "hydrates" this content by attaching event listeners and initializing the application's state. This approach combines the benefits of server-side rendering (faster initial load, better SEO) with the interactivity of client-side applications. Frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte use hydration to create performant, SEO-friendly web applications that provide rich user experiences.
